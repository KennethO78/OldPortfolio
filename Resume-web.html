			<h2 style="text-align:center">All Around Programmer</h2>
            
<p>With the ability of being an all around programmer, I can not only tell you one thing that I am good! I have always loved coding and i'm always in the need to learn new stuff for my projects. Since i'm 20 years of age, I still have a lot to learn but i'm rushing head first to learn as much as possible! I work greatly with others and always pushing others to do their best then to go even father than that. Since i'm a coder, problem solving is what i'm great at, it's always great to face new challenges.</p>
